âœ¨ I'm a software engineer (R&D) in [Semut](https://semut.io), and founder of a startup based in Bangalore, India. Iâ€™m passionate about wide variety of computer science topics, but I like to work on performance aspect of stuff. I am also an advocate for building, fostering and supporting open-source projects. 

Iâ€™m also a big advocate for building open and inclusive communities which led me to make the EinsteinPy Project community a better place to be in. I like to payback to the society, so I am also contributing to some organisations which work on similar lines. When I'm not coding you can find me gazing stars using my telescope ðŸ”­.
